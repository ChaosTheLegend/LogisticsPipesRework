/**
 * Routes computed on one snapshot, plus what is needed to decide cheaply whether they still hold on a later one.
 * <p>
 * A result stays valid on a newer snapshot when
 * <ol>
 * <li>nothing in the source's component changed at all (O(1) stamp check), or</li>
 * <li>the component is still the same one ({@link ComponentInfo#identity}), none of the improvements logged since the
 * routes were computed can beat them ({@link #survives}), and every corridor the routes use still has the version
 * recorded here and leads to an active junction.</li>
 * </ol>
 * The edge-version check alone is not enough on a graph with loops: a corridor elsewhere that became cheaper, or a new
 * corridor, can produce a shorter route that avoids every recorded edge. Worsening changes (removal, higher weight,
 * lost flag) cannot beat a route that does not use the worsened corridor, so they are never logged.
