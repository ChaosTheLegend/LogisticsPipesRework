 * apply in one direction), so each junction owns the corridors leaving it and the reverse corridor is a separate edge
 * owned by the other junction.
 * <p>
 * Edges are immutable because graph snapshots are immutable. "Bumping the version" means the writer replaces the edge
 * with a copy that has the same {@link #id} and {@code version + 1}; a cached route that recorded the old version then
 * no longer matches.
