## Routing and item transport

### B1: Bounced items lose their jam list when they have nowhere to go
- **Status:** needs repro
- **Found:** 2026-09-30, by reading code
- **Where:** `PipeTransportLogistics.resolveRoutedDestination` / `updateEntity` (item buffer)
- **Notes:** An item with no destination is buffered without its routing info (`Triplet` value 3 is `null`). On retry a
  fresh item is created, so the jam list with the sinks that already rejected it is lost. It can be sent back to a sink
  that just bounced it. The full-sink room cache limits this but doesn't remove it.

### B2: Basic pipe touching several inventories only checks the first one for room
- **Status:** open (known limitation)
- **Found:** 2026-09-30, by reading code
- **Where:** `ModuleItemSink.targetInventory()` → `PipeItemsBasicLogistics.getPointedInventory`
- **Notes:** Delivery picks a random adjacent inventory, but the room check only looks at the first one found. The pipe
  can claim room it doesn't have, or skip room it has. A failed insert marks the item as full and reroutes it, so it
  doesn't loop.

### B3: `PipeContentRequest` can never be answered
- **Status:** needs repro
- **Found:** 2026-09-29, by reading code ([lag-investigation.md](lag-investigation.md) §1.3)
- **Where:** `LPTravelingItem.serverList`, `PipeContentRequest:22`
- **Notes:** `serverList` is never filled, so a client asking for an unknown item's contents gets no reply.

### B4: Item packets go to players in other dimensions
- **Status:** needs repro
- **Found:** 2026-09-29, by reading code ([lag-investigation.md](lag-investigation.md) §1.3)
- **Where:** `MainProxy.isAnyoneWatching`
- **Notes:** The check ignores the dimension.

### B5: Client-known item IDs are tracked globally, not per player
- **Status:** needs repro
- **Found:** 2026-09-29, by reading code ([lag-investigation.md](lag-investigation.md) §1.3)
- **Where:** `LPTravelingItem.clientSideKnownIDs`
- **Notes:** One global sliding bitset of 2^20 IDs. A player who joins later may never get the full item contents
  packet for an ID another player already received.

### B6: Items in flight drop when the network loses power
- **Status:** open (behaviour to decide)
- **Found:** 2026-09-30, by reading code
- **Where:** `PipeItemsBasicLogistics.getTransportLayer().stillWantItem`, `ChassiTransportLayer.stillWantItem`
- **Notes:** `sinksItem` checks `canUseEnergy`. If power runs out while items are in flight, they are rerouted, find
  nothing, wait about 10 s and drop. Basic pipes used to deliver them anyway.

### B18: Some pipes stay unpowered after joining a powered and an unpowered island
- **Status:** fixed (2026-09-30), tested in game
- **Found:** 2026-09-30, in game
- **Repro:** 1) build a small network with a power junction attached 2) build another network nearby, don't power it
  3) connect both with a transport/basic pipe. Some pipes in the unpowered part show as disconnected/unpowered.
- **Notes:** Those pipes are skipped by routing or don't work at all, and render wrong.
- **Cause:** Placing the joining pipe makes both end routers publish their corridors separately, so for a moment the
  graph has the islands merged but only a one-way corridor. A pipe that polls power in that window (every 10 ticks)
  caches "no route to the power junction". Two things then kept that answer:
  - `ValidatedRoutes.isTraversable` counted an "unreachable" entry as traversable, because it has no corridors to
    check. The engine served it stale.
  - `JunctionRouter.powerView()` pinned the stale answer to the new graph snapshot. The fast path returned "unpowered"
    until the graph changed again, which a quiet network never does.
- **Fix:** `isTraversable` returns false for entries with no corridors, so "unreachable" is recomputed instead of
  served stale. `powerView()` only ties its view to a snapshot when all its routes are valid on it. Regression test:
  `RouteCacheTest.unreachableIsNeverServedStaleAfterAMerge`.

### B19: Items left over after an inventory fills stay in the pipe buffer instead of going to the next sink
- **Status:** fixed partially (2026-09-30), tested in game, same cause as B18
- **Found:** 2026-09-30, in game
- **Repro:** 1) place 2 or more small inventories (tested with GT lead chests) and connect them with basic pipes 2) push
  some items into the network 3) the first inventory fills up, and the rest of the clump stays in that pipe's buffer
  instead of being rerouted to the next pipe.
- **Notes:**The reroute itself works: the bounced item puts the full pipe on its jam list and asks for a new
  destination. It finds none because the other sinks answer "no" from `canUseEnergy`. Building the network by placing
  pipes goes through the same half-merged state as B18, so those pipes could be pinned as unpowered. With no
  destination, the items wait in the buffer (about 10 s) and are then dropped.
- While the fix works, the bounced items get returned to the default route without checking if there are other basic pipes that can accept this item, this makes large storage networks to fill up chests very slowly
- **Check after the fix:** if items still stay in the buffer with every pipe powered, the cause is something else.
  Note the pipe layout: does the next pipe touch the full chest too, and is it a default route or filtered?

### B20: Bounced items go to the default route while filtered sinks still have room
- **Status:** fixed (2026-09-30), tested in game
- **Found:** 2026-09-30, in game (while retesting B19)
- **Repro:** extractor pipe, several small chests on basic pipes with a filter for the item (one chest per pipe), and a
  separate default route. Items that bounce off the first full chest go to the default route, while newly extracted
  items keep filling the other chests.
- **Cause:** Nothing reserved room for items in flight:
  - `ModuleItemSink` only checked "room for 1 more" and ignored items already on their way. The extractor kept aiming
    fresh items at the next small chest, and bounced items, which had further to travel, arrived after it filled.
  - Rerouted items were never counted as in transit to their new destination. `assignDestinationFor` set the
    destination without `notifyOfSend`, so even `ChassiModule`'s in-transit check missed them.
  - Each extra bounce put that chest on the item's jam list. After a few, every filtered sink was excluded and only
    the default route was left.
- **Fix:** `ModuleItemSink` subtracts `countOnRoute` from the room and limits its reply to what's left, as
  `ChassiModule` does. `assignDestinationFor` registers a rerouted item as in transit to its new destination.

### B21: Bounced items sometimes fail to reroute and drop into world
- **Status:** possibly fixed (2026-09-30)
- **Found:** 2026-09-30, in game (while testing B20)
- **Repro:** 1) Place a lot of basic pipes with chests attached (tested with 16x16 grid), 2) extract items into the network. Chest will fill up, some items will bounce and try to reroute, but eventually some won't be able to find a router and drop
- **Suggested fix (if nothing else works)** make a last effort check for basic pipes, if there's no destination to reroute after 5 tries, try to reroute to default route, if even that fails only then drop items
- **Likely cause:** leftover in-transit reservations. When a reroute assigns a destination but `RouteLayer` then finds
  no exit (routes changing while many items reroute), `resolveRoutedDestination` buffers the stack without its routing
  info. The destination keeps counting it as in transit (new since B20) until the 640-tick (32 s) timeout. In a busy
  grid these phantom reservations make sinks look full, and bounced items run out of their 5 retries (~10 s) and drop.
- **Fix (2026-09-30):**
  - A stack buffered without its routing info now releases its destination's reservation first.
  - The suggested fallback above, for all routed pipes: when an item is out of retries, it goes to the nearest default
    route that has physical room (ignoring room promised to items in transit). It only drops if there's none
    (`LogisticsManager.assignDefaultRouteFor`).

## Rendering

### B7: Pipe model doesn't update when a neighbour's shape changes
- **Status:** needs repro
- **Found:** 2026-09-30, by reading code
- **Where:** `LogisticsNewRenderPipe.fillObjectsToRenderList` (`sideNormal` scaling), `PipeRenderState.cachedRenderer`
- **Notes:** Connected sides are stretched to the neighbour block's bounds. The cached parts list is only cleared when
  the connection/texture state or the solid sides change. A neighbour that changes shape without changing either
  (e.g. one non-solid block replaced by another with different bounds) keeps the old stretch until something else
  invalidates the cache.

## Performance

### B8: Particles cause server and client lag when enabled
- **Status:** open (workaround: `enableParticleFX=false` in the server config)
- **Found:** 2026-09-30, in game
- **Where:** `CoreRoutedPipe.spawnParticleTick`, `PipeFXRenderHandler`
- **Notes:** Every pipe that spawned a particle sends its own `ParticleFX` packet every tick to every player watching
  the chunk. Fix idea: throttle per pipe, or batch per chunk and tick.

### B9: Full sink modules other than the item sink stay registered as destinations
- **Status:** open
- **Found:** 2026-09-30, by reading code
- **Where:** ore dict, mod-based, polymorphic, creative tab, enchantment and other sink modules
- **Notes:** Only `ModuleItemSink` drops its interests when its inventory is full. The others are still found by every
  destination search. On chassis, `ChassiModule`'s room check still rejects the item, but only after a distance query and
  a `countOnRoute` scan.

### B10: Loading a large pipe network lags the client and server
- **Status:** possibly fixed (2026-09-28)
- **Found:** in game ([pattern-crafting.md](pattern-crafting.md) §10)
- **Where:** `RouterManager`, `JunctionRouterManager`
- **Notes:** `getOrCreateRouter` scanned every known router for each pipe that loaded, O(n²). Both managers use a
  position index now. Confirm with spark.

## Pattern crafting (found in game)

Reported in [pattern-crafting.md](pattern-crafting.md) §10. The detailed issue table in §8 has candidate causes.

### B11: Items get stuck when requesting crafts for machines in blocking mode
- **Status:** open
- **Found:** in game
- **Notes:** Happens even when the machine is empty. Possibly C8, or C1/C2.

### B12: Items aren't dropped when a crafting pipe is broken
- **Status:** open
- **Found:** in game

### B13: Items teleport to satellite pipes instead of travelling to them
- **Status:** open
- **Found:** in game
- **Notes:** Satellites insert straight into their machine.

### B14: Pattern crafting pipe voids excess fluids when the network has no storage for them
- **Status:** open
- **Found:** in game
- **Notes:** Expected: halt, then either keep crafting in non-blocking mode or wait with an error until there's space.
  Nothing should be voided.

## GUI and compatibility

Tracked in [pattern-crafting.md](pattern-crafting.md) §8.6. Expected to fail until fixed:

### B15: Some MUIs drop client edits
- **Status:** open (G11)
- **Where:** `PipeFluidSupplierMk2Mui`, `ModuleProviderMuiDynamic`
- **Notes:** Value sync handlers without `allowC2S()`.

### B16: Shift-click into pipe upgrade slots doesn't work
- **Status:** open (G12)
- **Where:** MUI slots over `ItemIdentifierInventory`, e.g. `UpgradeManager.getUpgradeInventory`

### B17: Crash without NEI installed
- **Status:** open (G9)
- **Where:** `PatternFluidStack` calls NEI's `StackInfo` from common code → `NoClassDefFoundError`
